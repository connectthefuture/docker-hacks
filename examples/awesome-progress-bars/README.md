##Awesome Progress Bars

This is DockerGVL's submission for Global Hack Day 3. We decided that the normal progress bars that the user sees
when pulling images, extracting them, etc. are far too boring. As such, we overhauled them to present a random 
"Docker Animal" for each progress bar that will swim across the sea that is your terminal session as images are pulled down.
The goal was to represent all of the mascots of Docker (including Gordon the turtle), so the animals can be one of:
[🐢, 🐙, 🐟, 🐳].
