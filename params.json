Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable filesystem such as aufs and others to allow independent \"containers\" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.\r\n\r\nReference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software))\r\n\r\n# Why Docker ?\r\n\r\nDocker is one of the popular open source projects that has been developing and evolving on the infrastructure platform.\r\nWIP(Work in Progress)....\r\n\r\n# Contents:\r\n\r\n* [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/coolhacks/docker-hacks/tree/master/dockerfiles)\r\n* [Docs](https://github.com/coolhacks/docker-hacks/tree/master/docs)\r\n* [Examples](https://github.com/coolhacks/docker-hacks/tree/master/examples)\r\n\r\n# Contributing: \r\n\r\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\r\n\r\n- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).\r\n- Make commits of logical units.\r\n- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\r\n- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.\r\n- Submit a pull request to the original repository.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contributions!\r\n\r\nCheck out [Contributing](https://github.com/coolhacks/docker-hacks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) section for more details.\r\n\r\n# License:\r\n\r\nThe content of this repo is released under the MIT License by [Ramit Surana](http://ramitsurana.github.io).\r\nYou can find a copy of this license in [LICENSE](https://github.com/coolhacks/docker-hacks/blob/master/LICENSE) or at http://opensource.org/licenses/mit.\r\n\r\n",
